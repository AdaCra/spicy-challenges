document.querySelectorAll
Go to this website, open the developer tools and then open the JavaScript console.

You can write JavaScript code into the console and execute it.

Use document.querySelectorAll to retrieve a list of all h2 elements on this page.

Log the result to the console and inspect the result.

Single Page Application
Up until now, we've used several HTML files for our app. In contrast, we can create a SPA (single-page application): It loads only a single web document and updates the body content of that single document via JavaScript.

In the following Challenges, there is a dummy SPA of the Quiz App; additionally, there are two enhanced versions which make use of forEach in order to improve and reduce the necessary code.

SPA 1: a working solution

SPA 2: simplified with forEach

npx ghcd@latest spicedacademy/fs-web-exercises/tree/main/sessions/js-array-methods/spa-2
SPA 3: forEach within forEach

npx ghcd@latest spicedacademy/fs-web-exercises/tree/main/sessions/js-array-methods/spa-3
Working in groups, use the Challenges above. Make sure that every student understands every single line of code and is able to explain it.
